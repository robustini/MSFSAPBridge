# MSFS 202x – ArduPilot Bridge

MSFS–ArduPilot Bridge is a lightweight Windows utility that connects **Microsoft Flight Simulator (MSFS)** with **ArduPilot-based setups** (SITL, companion tools, or integration utilities).  
It uses **SimConnect** to read simulator state and exposes it via a **JSON-over-UDP** interface, specifically designed to feed the ArduPilot JSON backend.

The goal is to provide a simple bridge layer between a full-featured desktop simulator and the [ArduPilot](https://ardupilot.org/) ecosystem, allowing you to fly ArduPilot SITL vehicles within the MSFS visual environment.

## ✨ Features

- **Bidirectional Bridge**   Connects MSFS (SimConnect) to ArduPilot SITL (JSON frame).

- **Multiple Positioning Modes**
  - **MP SITL (Auto-Origin)** – Automatically sets the local origin to the aircraft's starting position (ideal for Mission Planner's internal SITL to avoid coordinate jumps).
  - **Position** – Uses a fixed origin defined in the configuration (sends local vector only).
  - **LLA** – Uses a fixed origin but sends full Latitude/Longitude/Altitude + local vector (ideal for WSL2/global SITL setups when supported).

- **Joystick Integration**   Reads DirectInput devices and forwards axes/buttons to ArduPilot as RC overrides (no need for MAVLink joystick forwarding).

- **Compact C++ Codebase**   Minimal dependencies, focused on performance and clarity.

- **Persistent Configuration**   All interface settings are saved to a configuration file and loaded automatically upon startup.

- **SITL Sensor Debug**   All sensors coming from MSFS via SimConnect can be monitored in a live view popup window.

- **Sensor Logging**
  If enabled, the software creates a CSV file containing all sensor data from SimConnect and other useful metrics for debugging or flight analysis.

## 🧩 Requirements

- Microsoft Flight Simulator **2020 or 2024**
- **SimConnect SDK** and `SimConnect.dll`
- Windows 10 or later
- **Visual Studio 2022** (Desktop development with C++ workload)
- An **ArduPilot SITL** environment (Mission Planner internal SITL, WSL2, or standalone)

> ### SimConnect note
> To run the bridge, `SimConnect.dll` must be present in the same folder as `msfs_ap_bridge.exe`.  
> This DLL is **not** included in the distribution for copyright reasons.  
> To install the MSFS 2020/2024 SDK:
> - Enable *Developer Mode* in MSFS.
> - Use the new menu bar entry to download the SDK.
> - Extract the downloaded ZIP and run the main installer.
> - SimConnect and related headers/libraries will be installed on your system.

## 📥 Download

Prebuilt Windows binaries are available in the
[Releases](../../releases) section of this repository.

Download the latest `.zip`, extract it, and make sure that
`SimConnect.dll` is in the same folder as `msfs_ap_bridge.exe`
(see the SimConnect note above for details).

---

## 🛠 Build with Visual Studio 2022

1. **Get the sources**  
   You can either clone the repository or download the ZIP archive.

   **Clone with Git**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/robustini/MSFSAPBridge.git
   ```

2. **Open in Visual Studio**
   - Start **Visual Studio 2022**.
   - `File → Open → Folder...`.
   - Select the folder containing `CMakeLists.txt`.

   Visual Studio will automatically configure the CMake project via CMake.

3. **Build**
   - Select configuration: `Release` / `x64`.
   - Build the project (e.g. *Build → Build All*).

   The executable `msfs_ap_bridge.exe` will be generated in the build output directory for the selected configuration.

## 🎮 Usage

### 1. Start Microsoft Flight Simulator

- Launch MSFS and spawn your aircraft at the desired location (airport, runway, etc.).  
- Optionally choose a joystick as your primary control device.  
- **Important:** remove or unbind control-surface and throttle assignments for that joystick inside MSFS.  
  These controls will instead be driven by **ArduPilot via the bridge**, avoiding overlapping or conflicting inputs.

### 2. Start the Bridge

- Run `msfs_ap_bridge.exe`.
- In the **SITL Connection and Status** section, leave the initial defaults:
  - IP: `127.0.0.1` (localhost)
  - Ports: TX = `9003`, RX = `9002`
  - Position mode: `MP SITL` (recommended for Mission Planner’s internal SITL)
- Select the joystick you want to use as ArduPilot's **RC input** from the joystick dropdown.

The status LEDs will indicate connectivity for Sim, TX, RX, and joystick.

### 3. Start ArduPilot SITL

The bridge expects **JSON frame** SITL output.

#### Mission Planner (recommended for first-time users)

1. Open **Mission Planner**.
2. Go to the **Simulation** tab.
3. In **Model**, choose `plane` (or the vehicle type you want to simulate).
4. In **Extra command line**, enter:
   ```text
   --model json
   ```
5. Click the plane icon at the bottom to start SITL.

Mission Planner will download and start ArduPilot SITL using the JSON backend and connect to the bridge.  
Once everything is running, the bridge's *SITL Connection and Status* section should show all green LEDs with sensible rates.

For this workflow, keep **Position mode = MP SITL (Auto-Origin)**.

#### Advanced users – WSL / standalone SITL

You can also run ArduPilot SITL from WSL or a native environment using `sim_vehicle.py` and JSON output.

Example:
```bash
sim_vehicle.py -v ArduPlane -f json --sim-address 172.26.16.1 --console --map
```

Where `172.26.16.1` is the IP address of Windows as seen from WSL.  
In the bridge configuration, you must obviously enter the WSL IP address instead.

- In this setup, use **Position mode = Position** in the bridge.

#### LLA mode and ArduPilot JSON backend

By default, ArduPilot's JSON backend does **not** support receiving full geographic coordinates directly from the simulator.  
This limitation can be removed by compiling ArduPilot with the following pull request applied:

> https://github.com/ArduPilot/ardupilot/pull/31543

When using a firmware built with that PR, you can select **`LLA`** as the position mode in the bridge, and MSFS will send full Lat/Lon/Alt to SITL.

---

## ⚙️ Configuration

On first launch, the application automatically creates a configuration file
with the same name as the executable (by default `msfs_ap_bridge.ini`)
in the same folder.

Manual creation or editing of this file is usually unnecessary: settings can be
changed from the UI and are saved back to the `.ini` file.  
The example below is only for reference or advanced/manual tweaking.

```ini
[bridge]
# Target IP for ArduPilot SITL (usually localhost)
ip = 127.0.0.1

# Ports must match your SITL configuration
port_tx = 9003  ; Bridge sends sensor data to SITL on this port
port_rx = 9002  ; Bridge receives PWM/servo data from SITL on this port

# Simulation rate (Hz)
rate = 1000

# Positioning Mode (crucial for stability)
# 0 = MP SITL (Auto-origin for Mission Planner SITL)
# 1 = Position (fixed origin, sends local vector)
# 2 = LLA      (fixed origin, sends Lat/Lon/Alt + vector)
pos_mode = 0
```

Other options (not shown here) allow control of resampling, timing, and other advanced behaviors.

## 🎛 Joystick & ArduPilot Configuration

The most delicate part of the setup is making ArduPilot "accept" your joystick mapping through the bridge.

### In the bridge UI

- Map joystick axes and buttons to the desired RC channels.
- Use the **reverse** options in the bridge UI (not in ArduPilot) to correct directions as needed.
- Treat the bridge as your “virtual RC radio” for SITL.

### In ArduPilot

- Leave RC mapping and modes mostly at their defaults where possible.
- Perform a standard **Radio Calibration** (especially if using an actual RC transmitter forwarded into the system).
- Configure ArduPlane (or your chosen vehicle type) according to the official ArduPilot documentation.

The following parameters are particularly important for stable operation with MSFS via the bridge:

- `AHRS_EKF_TYPE = 10`
- `GPS1_TYPE     = 100`
- `INS_GYR_CAL   = 0`

Refer to the ArduPilot wiki for full context and tuning details.
